# College-Library-Management-System
- The proposed software product is the College Library Management System (CLMS). The system aims at making the task of the library easy. 
- The software keeps track of all the information about the books in the library, details of the issues, students, librarian, Fines and much more. 
- The scope of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the Libraryâ€™s book issue system.
- The system contains a database where all the information will be stored safely.
